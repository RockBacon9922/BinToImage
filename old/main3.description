This is a code implementing a hexdump utility in C language.

The hexdump utility is a command-line tool that displays the content of a file in hexadecimal format. This is often used for debugging and analyzing binary files.

The program reads a file and outputs its contents in hexadecimal format, as well as in ASCII representation. It also supports some options, such as specifying the number of columns to use and a range of offsets to dump.

Here is a brief summary of what the code does:

Defines some necessary headers, macros, and types.
Declares some global variables for options and a color map for formatting the output.
Defines the main function, which reads the command-line arguments and opens the input file.
Reads the input file in chunks and prints out the content in hexadecimal and ASCII formats.
Supports some options to customize the output format, such as specifying the number of columns and a range of offsets to dump.
Closes the input file and exits the program.
